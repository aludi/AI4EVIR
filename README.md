# Workshop AI4EVIR: AI for Evidential Reasoning

## Call for Papers
(in conjunction with JURIX 2025, 10–11 December, Turin)

Workshop date: 9 December 2025

Reasoning with evidence to establish relevant facts lies at the heart of legal reasoning. Technologies that allow us to reason about facts are evolving, and new kinds of evidence are becoming available (for example, digital forensic science). At the same time, reasoning with evidence is a dynamic and complex process: practitioners must decide what evidence to collect and how to interpret it amid vast amounts of data. These choices in selecting evidence and the following reasoning with evidence are complex tasks that may benefit from standardization and assistance by AI, for example, to avoid probabilistic and other fallacies.

The AI for Evidential Reasoning workshop aims to bring together researchers working on formal, computational, and empirical approaches to reasoning with evidence, as well as those with expertise in forensic science and evidence evaluation. The goal is to foster discussion and exchange between theoretical and applied perspectives on how AI can contribute to evidential reasoning in legal and investigative contexts.

The half-day workshop will feature:

- A keynote the evaluation of digital findings in forensic casework” by Marouschka Vink from the Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI)
- Paper presentations on accepted papers
- A discussion session focused on practical examples 

The workshop proceedings will be submitted to CEUR for publication.

-----------------

## Topics of interest
We invite contributions on topics including (but not limited to):

- Formal models of evidential reasoning (scenarios, arguments, probabilities)
- Hypothesis generation, falsification, and verification
- Methods such as Bayesian Networks, Chain Event Graphs, scenario-based reasoning, formal argumentation, Hypothesis Management Frameworks, etc.
-  Legal and commonsense reasoning with evidence
-  Empirical studies and data-driven analyses of reasoning with evidence
-  Case studies on real or hypothetical cases
-  Practical argumentation
-  Large language models (LLMs) and reasoning with evidence
-  Agentic and multi-agent approaches
-  Philosophical perspectives on the nature and role of evidence
